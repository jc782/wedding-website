Nayland, Suffolk. Parking available tbc. Once you have arrived everything within Nayland is in walking distance. 

## 4pm - Ceremony

At St James' Church, Nayland. 

## ~5:00pm - Reception

Walk from the Church to Cambridge House (this is also in Nayland, confusingly), where we will hold our reception. Drinks and canapes.

## ~6pm - Ceilidh

Everyone loves a ceilidh and the Brandon Ceilidh band will be on hand to get everyone active. Perhaps unusually this will be before dinner, what better way to work up an appetite though.

## ~9pm - Disco

Post dinner we have live music from the MP3s 

## ~11pm - End of play
